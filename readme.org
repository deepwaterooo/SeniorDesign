* Statement
  
It was a four day short project that I have just worked on during the passed weekend (11/7/2012-11/10/2014). This isn't any project to show off, but rather a review of the project, a review of the process practising and cultivating myself into a professional software engineer. Besides the most fundamental knowledge that we are supposed to learn on campus, students should also focus on the problem-solving skills so that, after graduation eventually we would be capable to learn cutting-edge knowledge, survive and succeed any project or requirements that we don't have any background, even without any instructor or mentor.
  
  I kept an original version of my *buttons_bk.h*, *buttons_bk.cpp*, and *main_bk.cpp* files in *./pic/backup_problemSolving/* folder for reference as they are the best indication of my problem-solving skills, because I didn't remove any trial that I have tried in order to get my project done.

* Course Introduction
** Reason for choosing this Course
   This fall semester I didn't have many course to choose at all. The all choices for me possible includes: 
  - Android App Programming
  - Fault Tolerance
  - Computer Networs Forensics
  - Paralell Programming
  - Software Design
I targeted for the <Android App Programming> course, and wanted to make it happen. I introduced myself to the instructor and said that I need some environmental force, like taking a 1 credit course to help me stay on schedule and learn some cutting-edge knowledge. I wanted to register 1 credit, but the instructor asked me to register 3 credits instead because I am a graduate student. 

My other choices included computer forensics. I attended couple of class, but there were so many terms that I could never guess the meaning without google translate. Initially the usual engineer outreach course - Parallel Programming was not open for our campus for this fall semester. After a week the department office confirmed that we were ok to choose parallel Programming, and I registered a 500 level. Both 500 level and 400 level required a project, just the project difficulty will be slightly different. I did registered 500 level, but as the registration deadline came closer and closer, I realized more and more that without any solid background, and the instructor being on another campus, I can be dead easily without even noticing anything. So the deadline day last night, I tried to change it back to 400 level, but I failed. So I will have to choose the followed <Software Design>.

I took software engineering course from a small scale one, and from my intern experience, I realized that as a software engineer, I should at least get some engineering idea common sense before I make any mistake. As I also lack design experience, that forms the reason I have to register this course for the fall semester when I have no any other better choice. 
      
** Expectations
  I don't have much team working experience except that I have worked in industry for quite some time. Just that I lack some computer science major team working experience. And I thought maybe I can benefit a lot from working in a team environment together with some talented students. 

* Project Introduction
** Project Selection
   It was not our choice who works on which project, but rather, assigned by the department course instructor, or by the department. Each of the student can list four choices, and will be assigned one. I have specific students that I want to work with the most, but I was not able to be assigned to his team. And I was left in this team's traditional old project "Tower Lights Animator".
   
   It's a old project that repeats each year maybe just for us students to get practised. Our current version of project was pretty much a fully functioning one, and it was writen by one ACM student who graduated already, and it was writen in C# with his own interest.

** Team Members and Contributions
   We have five members, and one of them is going to graduate this semester. Except me, all other students are undergraduates. Since I am the only graduate student here, I know that I am supposed to challenge all the difficulties if we could have any. 

* The Project Process
  
  I felt I must be in a lazy team or something, our team's performance is always just-so-so. The team manager seems to be assigned randomly within team, and I thought a female manager may just make the other gender happier, and that's all. I understand that all four of them are currently in compiler class, but still it was slowly. 
  
  We meet almost twice a week, but doesn't seem to be as efficient as it seems to be. Most of the time, we split into couple of subgroups without even noticing it. 
  
** Initial Point
During one meeting, one of our team member has helped us with Qt Creator installation and set-up. They all are using Windows right now for the project, but I like Linux too much and I just steak to Linux and installed Qt Creator there, and with that team member's sample program, it seemed that my Linux version of Qt Creator worked just fine. 

In the team member's sample program, a button menu bar "File" button was created, but during that meeting, with Qt Creator installed already, I wasn't able to compile and execute the program without the team member's help. At that point, I began to think that I should keep up with the team-mates. But still, with the other course's homework and exam, I didn't really start to do anything at all. 
   
** Snapshot Day
   The coming Tuesday will be this course's snapshot day, I felt like the whole team should meet together and we do well preparation for the snapshot day. So after Friday's TA meeting, I tried to get an old version of Animator software interface, so that I can spent some hours on the Qt to see how far I can reach from there.

    I want to get access to the interface the other day Dr. client has showed us when we have our client meeting. I know some of you have that interface, I tried in CSAC to load that .vcproj file, it built but failed to get the GUI interface.
    
    Anybody can help give simple instruction how to access and get the interface, or at least help attach an interface snapshot?
    
    Feels like we still get lots of things to do for the Snapshot day. Let me know if we need to gather together to prepare something materials.
    
    thanks,

    hi guys, 
    
    now i believe b is correct, Qt thing is really not that hard. I have worked two hours on it today and got a simply menu bar interface. I attached it in case anybody else besides me think maybe we could go ahead and create a simply interface for our Snapshot day. 
    
    Let me know any ideas you have about interface, and according to your response, let's see if we need to target make any progress this weekend. 
    
    thanks,
    me

    I states I worked two hours on the Qt, but actually I did work from 4:52pm ~ 8:06 pm three hours on the Qt, just that the first two hours are efficient, I used codes to implement the menubar. But the third hour was quite frustrating, because the wired Qt kept telling me layers on layers, blah...blah...blah... 
    
    I wrote to team-mates call for trial on GUI interface, but actually I was frustrated that evening and gave it up when nobody responded to me at all, and I never touched the "Qt" thing ever since that evening. 
    
*** Snapshot Day performance
    I thought we would meet and prepare for Tuesday's meeting, but all other team member's doesn't have any reply to my email at all, and the team manager was not saying anything. Then I just let it go. And Tuesday they said it was p and e prepared several pages of print out, and p used his graphics and video skills prepared a graphics interface design.    
    [[./pic/GUI.png]]
    
    There were barely any visitors in front of our broth, and really hoped if we had meet before, we should have performed better. But since they took the initiative to work on it, maybe I should just keep quiet. 
    
* New Assignments
** Team meeting
   On 10/23/2014, we have a team meet. There are several things that we needs to do, and these assignments are assigned to individual students as well. b was working on State diagram, e and r were going to work on class diagram, I chose to work on GUI, and p chose to join me to work on GUI design and documentation. The reason why I chose GUI? I don't really remember, maybe I considered that I am the graduate one, and I should work on the most difficult part, and Qt Creator at that time was a really bad experience for me. 

** Progress
   b's state diagram was finished pretty fast. I felt we didn't really review his diagram, but I knew he finished it already. I must be horrible experience trying to use code to separate frames. I barely made any progress, and meanwhile, my sub team-mate p taught me how to use qt form to create interface, I tried to add couple of them, and it did work easily! And I have spent about 1-2 hours on 10/31 Friday at noon to have some fun creating the form interface. On that Friday, when it's 1 pm, I went home to have rest and didn't continue. 

11/11 today will be the design review day. As deadline came closer and closer, my team-mates and I got to settle this GUI. On 11/7 afternoon, in the end of the team meeting, some team-mate asked if our interface is ready, and I answered my form interface hurts people's eyes. *Warning:* The form interface does hurt people's eyes, so be prepared~!
   
   [[./pic/form.png]]
   
   After team meeting, my sub team-mate and I went to CSAC, and I asked him some questions about using form how to add image-button images, but both of us failed to search any obvious answer. As frustrated as I was, he decided to make a telephone call to our team manager, and team manager told him we could still simply use graphics tools and MS power-point to make some fake graphics, as far as it's slightly better than the last version from snapshot day. He used his laptop taught me how to make a up-left arrow, and we agreed that I would work on it, and we would meet on Monday 2:30 to review and clear what's left. 

* Software Engineer's Hurt
  
  If you were not a software engineer, you won't be able to understand software engineer's pain when he has to use some graphics tools to get an interface image while he was supposed to use the correct software or codes to implement it, yet even when he was a computer science majored student, and supposed to be passionate on projects as well as supposed to learn any programming language without any difficulty (according to my small scale software engineer course instructor). 
  
  Last Thursday midnight 11/7, I was lying on the bed before sleep, but I felt shamed on myself if I were really going to use graphics tool to produce image interface. I have learned this major already, I have even implemented a simply python GUI interface one year ago, why change the library to be Qt, and suddenly, I still can not do it yet? When will be the right time for me to be able to do it?
  
  Even after 10 hour's continuous hard work on Qt, if I still failed, I would still have enough time to finish an image, so I must give it another try, and yet how difficult could this Qt Creator possibly be? 
  
  Form will always make interface ugly, I want to code the interface. "Tomorrow morning, I am going to code this gui, junk by junk, piece by piece, I must be able to do it~!" That evening, lying on the bed, I made up my mind that I must do it ~~!!
  
* I can do it ~~!
  
  Next morning Friday morning at 8:00am, I started from the left hand side grid. It seems like projects hate people to make up their mind, cause once people has a mind, nothing can break it except human being themselves~!
  
  I built left hand side grid in the morning, and I worked on searing directories images and adding buttons for "Grid Motion Menu" before, during and after Friday's TA meeting. I have worked about five hours (8~12~1-1class, 1-3pm I went home have rest) on Qt and up to 8:00pm before I went home, I was pretty much sure that I can do it ~~!! 

  At this point, I was very comfortable with c++ programming with more than 2 years programming experience. Then recall the GUI I designed last summer during the intern-ship, I had barely used Python before yet, it must be my mentor's great guide, team environment, together with my problem-solving skills, and passionate on projects that helped me to survive my very first GUI without understanding interface beforehand. How comfortable I was feeling right now with c++/Qt Creator programming, to the same extent how uncomfortable I was with Android App Programming course ~ I am not able to understand Android, still have minor Java programming uncomfortable, which resulted that I always depended on examples, and have barely any capability to develop my own code and project. How could I know what's the correct/good method to learn it?

I worked most of the time continuous on this project on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, and yet on each of these three days, I spent some time to work on my Android App Paint project for some hour so that I could finish my course priority on time. All the rest time, I was on this project. I felt drunk.  
  
* Problem-solving Skill Practise
   I have good problem-solving skills, yet on this project, I practised this capability even more. 
   
   I built all the easy ones first, and left only color-wheel and grid preview 5 frames undone. 

   5 frame preview was too many grids and I didn't know how to do it at beginning. The first intuition of getting around was to use separate grid program to generate five letters, took snapshots, and then loaded images as I did on buttons. But unfortunately, the images were just too small. 

   Then I searched and came QGraphicsScene QGraphicsView method, but still, just like I was not able to include a left hand side grid pointer in my button class, I could make QGraphicsScene QGraphicsView work in my main program, but I counldn't make it work for color-wheel, let alone the 5 grid frames. 

   Then I knew I could simple implement 5 grids just like left handside one, using same method to print letters. And left Color-wheel eventually came out to be a plugin class searched from online. 

   All the major modules were built properly, I began to link button functions. I started from "Browse". Once I figured out Q_OBJECT signal and slot, it worked soon; Then next step would be predefined 17 colors. I passed my button array index to my predefined slot function, but it never worked; Then instead of work on the whole array, I worked on one button first, click it, and tried to pass its background color to color preview button (besides Color wheel, right above predefined color array); I tested it, made it work, realized I have to write 17 slot functions for each button, while 17's labor work was still ok for me for now; Then it came to be 72 grid buttons. 

I redid the same thing as in array, I passed in grid pointer, and grid indics to one slot function, of course still, it wouldn't work; I hard coded and tested on one button again, like want grid[ 0 ][ 0 ] to pick the color I clicked from color array, it just worked with the slot function without parameters. 

It was Sunday evening, and I need get this done on time so that my subteammate could continue to label it and make documentations. I had to work like a slave to write 72 slot functions to make the grid be able to pick color. Even with emacs fast keys, it was still too painful. I must be missing some great mentor and team who offered help when I did need help, and leave me alone and struggle my way out when he believed that I have the capability to do it. What a pity when I was in difficulties, yet I didn't even have a keyword in mind to search for the answers, yet nobody else could possibly help me in the environment~

I labored and typed on Saturday until 1am; Sunday midnight, I didn't ride. I walked all the way home, on the way somewhere the old song came into my mind, "who you are, where are you from , what do you do? ~~"

* First GUI of Career

  My first GUI in my career was during my internship last summer. And I was required to use *Python Tkinter* module to implement a simple GUI interface for my previous mentor so that when she needs to extract data and plot the graphics, she could simply log my tiny software. It was a one week short project, and the interface has only five buttons. The "Select File" button triggle popup Windows to select from Windows system the series ".csv" file, multiple files can be selected, and the selected files would be listed on main frame; Then similarly select one x variable, one y variable, selected variables will be listed on main frame as well; "plot" button triggles graphics window, and "Exit" for quit. 

  I have never shown any picture of my first GUI during my internship any where before except one instructor on current campus, but I did take couple of picture of them. It was my last day's afternoon, after I was finish done with my project, I took them. That GUI could plots several lines on the same plot, just I didn't pay enough attention to take a picture of a series curve plot. 

  After I came back from internship, I told the instructor that I had suffered all kinds of failure psychologically because of the lack of enough engineering practise. And I showed the GUI I made to him so that he knew what I did during summer, at least for one project. And I appreciated the opportunity to be able to get mentored and practised and lead me into this computer science world.

* Project Benefits
** Programming skills
a very good practis of new libraries and problem-solving skills
** OOD
a good practis of OOD, though quite a few of them still didn't design well, and I still needs review with teammates in order to well design and implement review scrolling. 
** Functions
- Last color used could be preserved;
- New picked color can be previewed;
- Predefined 17 colors are clickable;
- Design grid 72 buttons are clickable to get background color set;

* Easy Undone Parts for Fall semester
- Color Wheel was a plugin, and haven't link/activiate color-picking yet;
- "Frame Start Time" & "Increment Amout" needs to be in format of "00:00.000";
- Latest color used is preserved, yet 2nd, 3rd, 4th Latest ones are not able to be remembered yet; Color queue 3 buttons behind direction square are not implemented (which is very easy).
- RGB values are supposed to get value set from predefined color, color wheel, or latest 2-4 color queue, undone yet. 
- "Clear" & 8 directions are easy to implement and will be done by end of this semester;
- Yet I will take my time to finish all the color/time/direction related button slot functions by the end of this semester;

* Updates
  Since *after this point* (after today, after version *0.2*), it will be a team project, I will always make my updates here in my repository first with updated contents in this README, then I will git update to https://github.com/PaulCode/Tower-iLLuminati team project repository.

  Since version *0.5*, it is an individual project, will *ONLY* update here since *11/20/2014*.

** version 0.2 11/13/2014, updates include
- *clean code* - removed all unnecessary conments, methods and variables;
- "*pre*" button stores the latest used color, and it's clickable;
- "*cur*" button stores the latest previewed color, and it's clickable;
- Red Green Blue spinBoxes are able to show the corresponding QColor r g b values;
- Modified setColor 5 functions to use setStyleSheet(...) method to set colors (instead of previous QPalette setColor(...) and setAutoFillBackground(true) method.); Solved Windows not showing color problem; (details: I have tried the setStyleSheet(...) method for my 17 predefined colors, but when I needed to get the color, I failed my basic test with the mistake used string instead of *QString*, so later on need to pay more attention to details.)

** version 0.3 11/15/2014, updates include
- fixed the mistake of setting default color to be (211,211,211), but actually should be (239,235,231);
- modified predefined slot for pushing button down, trial;
- my refactor and design plan

** Review Team Meeting on 11/16/2014 11:00-4:00 pm
- A team member lead the meeting, and on that day we mainly reviewed menu bar, all pictures are named in ./pic/IMG_059?.JPG style; Those pictures are team Contributions, *not only* mine; The *coding implementations* are all *mine* though. 
- The idears are mainly M, me and r's contributions for menubar and for main design; My contributions were mainly more common sense ones, like color gradient (which was still original came from Dr. client), and cut, copy, paste, first frame, last frame command buttons etc, while m was the leading force for design, and r for confirmation. 
- Team manager helped record review contents for this meeting;
- Team manager blamed me for having misunderstood her that nobody asked me to implement a GUI instead of designing a GUI. This saying was immediately criticised by another team member out of fairness that if it was not her, the team manager, we should have designed and reviewed all our designs three or four weeks ago. I can't hold my anger neither said back to her that it was all her -- the team manager's fault, and I will prove and make it clear that it was all her fault, not mine. 
- Team manager offered only one piece of suggestion of IMG_0595.JPG design against my (even p and e's from snapshot day image design) original IMG_0596.JPG design; 
- Team manager's design was initially rejected by me due to layout intuition and human eye monitor widescreen design concepts; but was also later rejected by both r and m, and r implemented form-based interfaces of both layouts and new proposed design layout was too narrow. Having seen me writing email to manager just as I stated earlier during waiting for pizza time, r applied his power rejected the manager's proposal. And that was mainly r and m's contribution for comparing proposals. 
- By the end of meeting, manager's new layout design was completely rejected by the team. We agreed on the only existing basic layout. 
- p just got permanent position late last week (11/13/2014) from neighboured company, and began fully supporting manager's idea that he doesn't seem to do anything by not offering ideas but accompany manager to get pizza and help maintain a friend environment. But like always, I have full confidence on him. 

** version 0.4 11/18/2014, updates include
- Removed self-defined buttons.h and buttons.cpp file, used default *mainwindow.h* and *mainwindow.cpp* file instead because MainWindow inherited from QMainWindow satisfies all our requirements, the self-defined buttons inherited from QWidget can NOT satisfy all the requirements, like menubar and central layout;
- Added menus according to our design on just passed Saturday;
- Self added "*close file*" toolBar option, and just got accepted during today's meeting;
- Removed .tan file open line menu from main layout;
- Redesigned First/Play/Pause/Stop/Last commnad line;
- Up to this point, understood Qt Creator fairly well. May feel boring to update according to our design review, but if necessary, I would still insist to update it accordingly to keep this project in progressing mode, but with *LOW PRIORITY* later on.
- Current GUI Interface looks like followed, but still have work I need to do, like color-wheel, and user defined colors link into predefined color array. 
[[./pic/2014-11-18_11:12:25.png]] 

** version 0.5 11/20/2014, *Individual Project*
- This project for me just turned out to be an individual project, and today I was required to finish my individual design without joining to old team, finish the whole project design and finish an so-far decided to be 15-20 page documentation as well to indicate my design ideas and ability to keep documentations organized (Will I be challenge for writing a 15-20 pages documentation? - Maybe.). 
- I mean to learn from team project experience (m and p have always been valueable team members before, and the others as well), but since the instructor doesn't allow me to work in the team any more, I could still work hard to make this a personally-spearking good design experience. I would review my pregress with my course instructor after thanks-giving break, and right now, I still intend to implement an outline of my design, so that later on when the department makes decision, this design course could be kept as an option for me for my spring semester. 
- the *./docs/* folder kept all the documents the team has before *today 11/20/2014 16:43*, will be marked so it will be clear which part won't be my contribution.  
- My current GUI layout: and my *individual project and design* goes from *this point here today*. 
[[./pic/2014-11-20_16:25:50.png]]

** version 0.6 11/21/2014, *Global Agreement - Graduate*, updates include
- Worked a little bit on the docs that I am required to do;
- worked a little bit on the popup window when click/conduce "play";
- Redesing the play command line buttons according to my taste;

  [[./pic/2014-11-21_17:20:11_GlobalAgreementGraduate.png]]

** *Global Agreement - Graduate*: 11/21/2014
- Reach *Global Agreement* with the department (my major advisor told me the good news) that I could *graduate* in summer 2015, with registering 1 credit part-time for coming spring semester;
- There is *NO ANY* Ph.d on me, and my advisor clearly stated that nobody here in the department would want to block me here on campus forever.
- Use picture ./pic/2014-11-21_17:20:11_GlobalAgreementGraduate.png to set a mark here;

** version 0.7 11/27/2014, updates include
- Highlight valid frame & current viewing frame bolder to be *Red* color;
- Finished a simple *Animation Popup* window design and implementation as layout below. This popup window should be linked with "*play*" button when it gets clicked. Popup window is designed as to the client's requirement that he doesn't want to get disrupted by the other neighboured frames in main window. So the popup window frame is not highlighted to be RED any more. I could also remove the frame border if the client want that layout.

  [[./pic/Screenshot_from_2014-11-27_23:34:06.png]]
- Redesing & Implemented left handside working space QGridLayout to be 20*12 row*col, instead of old one 12*6 row*col;
- Redesing & Implemented bottom right predefined colors to be user custom colors with 34*2 options interactively changable/redefinable by user;
- Redesign & Implemented right bottom working area so it has a better layout;
- Redesign & Implemented QGridLayout setSpacing() values so that the working space grids and preview layouts mimic that actual tower window size;
- Current main window layout looks at listed below:

  [[./pic/Screenshot_from_2014-11-27_22:42:34.png]]

** version 0.8 12/05/2014, updates include
  will try to update 12/05/2014 as one version tomorrow
*** Project Shortcomings
- *Shortcomings* of this project implementation include: memory leak problems. I have created too many pointer to objects, but in my destructor, I was not aware the *delete* step for the *new* operator objects that I have created. 
  - *Solution 1:* I should delete all the new operator created pointer in my *~MainWindow* destructor in order to release resources. Realized and listed this shortcoming here, I will take my time later on when I finished my priorities to. Add all the *new* operator pointers to be MainWindow private pointers; Add the *delete* operations in MainWindow destructor for all the new operator pointers;
  - *Solution 2:* Instead of using *new* operator to create them, maybe I could create them on stack;
  - *Solution 3:* Qt specific solution. Link the layouts to their parent so that when close, everything will be handled by Qt smartly. I cleaned some unnecessary widget pointer declaration in the *mainwindow.h* file which were mainly for menubar; I have done about first 300 lines of codes linking in my *mainwindow.cpp* file, but the labor for the rest parts can be done later instead of now. 
- *Shortcomings* of this project implementation include: I still remembered the very convenient and readable camelCase naming convention my internship mentor applied on his Python Test Suite Automation Framework, like "__" prefix for variables wihtin a class means the variables are private class variables, together with those camelCase variable and function names. But for this Senior Design project, when I implemented the GUI, it was my fault that I completely left this naming convention behind forgotten. Here are some points to address this (*Quote* from <Programming with Qt: Writing Portable GUI Applications on Unix and Win32> page 422 by *Mattias Dalheimer*). 
  - In a large project, you man have many dialog box (or other) classes generated by Qt Designer and uic (Qt Creator too?) and implementation classes for many of those dialog boxes. In such a situation, it is best to think of a smart naming scheme right away to avoid confusion later. 
  - There are two demands on such a naming scheme: it should be easy, obvious, and unique to get from the generated class name to the implementation class name (or the other way around), and the class name should not be too cumbersome to type. 
  - One naming scheme that fulfills these conditions is that the generated dialog box class gets the name that seems "natural" (such as *PizzaEntry*), and the implementation class gets the same name with *Impl* attended.
  - Another option that some people prefer is to give the generated class a name that ends in *Base*, such as *PizzaEntry*Base*, and the subclass the original name, such as *PizzaEntry*. Since you willl use the subclass only in your code, naming the class in this way can keep your code a bit more readable. 
  - Many schemes are equally good. The important thing is that you pick one consistent scheme and stick to it throughout your project. 
*** Design & Implementation Updates
**** General Updates
- Redesing & Implemented right bottom working area so it includes the *priority options* layout on the right which sets priorities when different patterns merge;
- Highlight *Red:* *Green:* *Blue:* texts to be the specific color as well so that it's a more obvious indication layout;
- Design & Implemented *Frame Start time:* QDoubleSpinBox to show 8-digit hh:mm:ss timer counter; Design & Implemented *Increment Amout:* QDoubleSpinBox to show 9-digit mm:ss.001sec timer counter as well, by inherit QDoubleSpinBox to override a member function; I have tried and finished an python example layout stored in *./pic/backup_problemSolving/* folder, *QxDoubleSpinBox.py* and *Window.py* refered to a website listed below, can be refered as problem-solving indication. *Note:* Signals and Slots are working fine here, but minor issues with seconds showing and milloseconds showing for frame and Increment respectively; having not got any suggestive idears yet, but will look into it later on;
- Added .wav audio file parser into GUI for timestamps; Suggestive layout comes out to been listed below, which has a timestamp double spinbox to show the detailed time and parsed wave drawing picture:

- My design for user predified colors, Qt Quick dynamic JS creation or regular QPushButton one as I am doing now? Maybe I should implement the project piece by piece, from easy to difficult updated implementation;
- Same happens to .wav file parser and graphics generatation. It's an interesting project with many potentials. I will come back to work on this one later when I solved my *priorities*, like my first priority will be to find a job which *sponsors H1B working Visa* for me before *4/1/2015*. 
- worked on the documents a little bit, the file can be view from *./mydocs/seniorDesign.org* file; From very beginning I never liked to write the document, but still even after I have put hard work on it, I still needs to finish the software design document according to requirement even individually. 
- Snapshot #2 will be from 8:30-10:20, but the final document report is not required for today.
- will add *Increment Amout* to *menu* option as well tomorrow;
**** Signals & Slots (Qt Essential)
- Linked *ColorWheel* signal with MainWindow slot function to get full color-picker function from this color-wheel, *done* with *color-wheel* functions, but the implementation ideas for color-wheel should be learned and grasped and adapted to be my own ideas for future implementations;
- for Qt Signals and Slots, so far I got three ideas how to implement the connection between signals and slots;
  - Inheritance to rewrite signals and redefine slots;
  - Use eventFilter to find signal sender(), and conduct the connection by scanning the widgets;
  - Most basic method that I implemented already, by connecting one by one, and repeat;
    The very first method I tried a little bit, but failed to get my pushbutton painted. But I can spend some time to debug this one, and I could also try the second method as well. There must be some way to facillate the linking process.
**** Qt: Code Less; Create More; Deploy Anywhere.
