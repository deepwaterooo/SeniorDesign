Hi,

Lab 11 is now posted at http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~cs120/f14/soule/lab11f14.html.
The lab itself is pretty simple, enter the code from the text, make some fairly simple modifications.
However, the concept behind the code is tricky and may be worth taking some time to explain at the beginning of lab.  The program creates a 2D array of pointers to robot objects.  This array represents the "world".  Most of the pointers are null, except when a robot is in a given cell in the world.  When a robot moves it is "handed' from pointer to pointer.

Let me know if there are any questions/concerns.

Thanks,
Terry
