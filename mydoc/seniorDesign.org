Execute Summary 1/2 page

Our current software is the v0.3 version writen in C#. And every "window" change needs a click. And the v0.2 was black and white, and since UI CS Curriculum is C++ based, we want to try our best to make a most basic software so that later on every ACM member with interest would be able to add any components that they are interested in and so that there won't be programming language barrier for them. 

It's a old project that repeats each year maybe just for us students to get practised. Our current version of project was pretty much a fully functioning one, and it was writen by one ACM student who graduated already, and it was writen in C# with his own interest.

* Project Background
- Motivation for the work
  
  Our cliend Dr. Rinker is very environment-friendly on campus, and he lead the ACM team for the department, and he enjoys offering music-related fun activities for the compus like tower light show for homecoming events. For tower light show, the current tower animator c#-programming based software plays the .tan light file type separately from the .wav audio file, which is not convenient for him and his ACM parties to use. 
  
- Identify the need
  
  Since University of Idaho Computer Science department is mainly c++-based programming, and the c# language does produce language barrier for a certain amount of ACM users, and the software is quite some distance from user-friendly and functionaly complete, there exist the need for potential refactor, reimplementaion, or update on this software. 
  
- Describe the expected benefits
  
  Reimplement and update the software in c++ language will promote ACM user attendence on product software updates and also, we, as the senior design team would be able to get good practise and benefit a long way from various aspects like programming technical practise, softare engineering, project design and handling, as well as problem-solving skills.

** Recommendations  for continued work
*** Features that didn't find their way into the current design
*** Estimate size and duration of the required effort
- Implement functionality to GUI
- Implement multiple pixel movement
- Figure out modifications to .tan file layout
- Next Semester
  - Implement more advanced animations/movements
  - Add more GUI features
